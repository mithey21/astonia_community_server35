# Long Tunnel

Starts at level 10, becomes usable at level 15+, but is really meant for level 25 upwards. HP do not regenerate here, healing, healing potions and Magic Shield are disabled.

You are put into a tunnel that has enemies -10 of your level. You have to choose one of two or tree paths a few times. Path differ in number of
enemies; some are deadends. The layout is randomized, but stays the same for every character and level, so you can memorize it.

At the end of the tunnel are two poles and a door. The door leads to the next section of the tunnel, which will be one level higher.

Or you can choose one of the poles to exit the tunnels and get either experience or military points. Choosing experience you get 10% of the experience value of that tunnel's level. 

This makes tunnels much less valuable at lower levels: At level 20, you only get 1.3% of a level (10% of 13.5%) for the first tunnel, while at level 50 you get 5.1% of a level.

If you can finish fives tunnels, a tunnel at -5 your level gives 4.3% to a level 20, and 7.3% to a level 50.

Choosing military points always fives a flat 50 mil-pts, making this a very quick way to level your rank, especially at lower levels.

Overall, the intention of this area was a test of skill (and memorization of the correct path) that was supposed to give you a significant boost to your exp or mil-pts ONCE.

While you can get the rewards for the same tunnel segment up to 20 times, they diminish quickly. The second time gives you 1/2, then 1/3, 1/4, etc. This was mainly meant as a consolation price if you make an attempt to go deeper but realize you cannot reach the end the next segment.
