## Jeepers Creepers (Aston, Kelly)

Targeted at level 15, but you might get it as early as lvl 12-13. Seems too hard at first. Rushing and war-crying kills you quickly. Sneaking and taking them one-by-one works fine. Stealth really shines here, even if unraised.

_Add hint about stealth to mission briefing?_
