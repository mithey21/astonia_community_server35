# Pents

## Experience
Main source of experience in pents is kill exp. You get the demon's level in exp (i.e. a level 12 demon gives you 12 experience points).

A governor mission essentially mirrors the kill exp you get for demons at the chosen level. In the end, that is a 50% kill exp bonus, since you get demons of two different levels in each section.

## Earth, Fire and Ice Stones
Pents are the main source of the stones needed to enhance items.

## Equipment
NPC drops are the only source of (enhance-able) equipment, and not all NPCs even drop special items. The demons in pents are the **best source of special items**.

## Military Points
Each governor mission gives the player 7-13 mil-pts. While sufficient at lower levels it quickly becomes too little to keep your rank rising along with your level.
